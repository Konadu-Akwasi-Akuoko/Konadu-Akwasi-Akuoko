<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Konadu Akwasi Akuoko!</h1>

Full stack software engineer
-----------------------------------------------------

At the Akenten Appiah-Menka University of Skills Training and Entrepreneurial Development, I am a student and I study Information Technology with Education. Algebra, calculus, probability and statistics, database design and implementations, an introduction to programming with C++, Java, and web technologies, operating systems, digital electronics, system architecture, and project management are just a few of the subjects covered at my school.

Because I concentrated mostly on designing full stack web applications while in school, I am incredibly adaptable in this area. As a result, I know how to construct websites utilizing the front-end frameworks ReactJS or NextJS, the back-end frameworks NodeJS and ExpressJS, the database technologies MondoDB, MySQL, or MariaDB, and the hosting technologies AWS, Heroku, Firebase, and Netlify. I was accepted as a teaching assistant at the Open Labs NIIT, Kumasi campus due to my expertise in programming languages and software development in general. I assisted the instructors at Open Labs NIIT in teaching ReactJS, MySQL, and Excel, among other subjects. Due to my love of education, I always helped the students when it was time for lunch or when class wasn't in session to ensure that they understood what the lecturer had taught them.

Additionally, I offered to lead the AAMUSTED Google Developer Student Club at my school, where I mostly aid in this effort by providing engaging seminars and activities that broaden students' knowledge of developer tools and platforms. In general, I am dedicated to supporting, expanding, and instructing the developer community at his school.
